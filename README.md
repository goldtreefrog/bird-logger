# Bird Watcher's Bird Log - Think Demo project

A responsive website with features including:

*   Store your bird sightings by date and species, along with your notes (in a Mongo DB).
*   Look up the scientific name of a bird from a common name.
*   Look up a description and picture of a bird (courtesy of The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's eBird project).

**NOTE:** Because this is a demonstration project, your data **will be deleted** from time to time. When and if this becomes a production system, I will change this very page to let everyone know. If you have a strong desire or need for such a system, please <a>{:href => "http://mendoclick.com/contact.htm"} contact me</a> to discuss how we can work together to meet your needs.
